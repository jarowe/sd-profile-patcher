But I do now.\nIt’s because, in that moment, you were showing me a dream that was pure. And deep down, all I wanted was to be with that woman. \n\nA woman whose dream was to love her children with everything she had and to explore the world together in wonderment. \n\nAnd now… just let that sink in.\n\nYou’ve become that woman—and so much more.\n\nJust look at you. You’ve not only become the woman you dreamed of—you’ve surpassed her in every way.\nYou’ve created a life that most people spend a lifetime hoping for.\nBut you didn’t stumble into it. You built it.\n\nYou’re now only 38, and already, you’ve painted a life more vivid and honest than most dare to dream.\nNot through luck or chance—but by choosing it, nurturing it, becoming it.\nYou didn’t just chase your dream—you embodied it.\nAnd in doing so, you’ve become a quiet revolution.\nA woman who lives so fully in her truth, she awakens others simply by being herself.\n\nThis past year alone—you’ve led us from Greece to Maine, through Acadia’s wild beauty, and across Europe once again—Spain, Germany, Austria, Italy. A dream life that’s somehow real. Because you made it so.\n\nAnd through it all, you’ve remained the strongest, most nurturing soul I’ve ever known.\nYou mother without asking for credit. You give without asking for thanks.\nYou plan, organize, carry, create—and you do it all with grace.\nYou are breathtaking in every way. And yet somehow, you continue to gain beauty with age.\n\nI’m ready to admit that I had to grow to see what you saw all along.\nAnd I’m so grateful I did—because this life we’ve built, this family, you—\nIt’s everything I never knew I wanted, until you showed me it was possible.\n\nIt is the greatest honor of my life to be your husband.\n\nHappy Birthday to the woman who makes life the most beautiful adventure.\nI love you beyond what words can hold.",

You’ve always moved fast. Thought fast. Eaten fast.

You care so deeply about the people you love, and you protect them with everything you’ve got.\n\nYou’re creative, thoughtful, hilarious, and full of light. Whether you’re baking your gluten free double tree oat cookies or drawing with that wildly vivid imagination of yours, you put your whole heart into it. And that is so special, and it shows in everything you do.\n\nWatching you with your brothers, or with your best friend Leo, is one of my favorite things in the world. That lemonade and orange juice stand you made outside your school, that wasn’t just cool that was magic.\n\nAnd every time you ask me for a bedtime story, my heart just swells. You don’t know what that means to me. You don’t know what you mean to me. But someday you will.\n\nMy eyes fill when I think about all the moments that shaped you into the boy you are, and the man you’ll one day become. You are a gift. So much light, and so much joy!\n\nIt’s an honor to be your dad. Truly. What a pleasure to say I’m your Father, Son.\n\nHappy golden birthday, Jole. I love you so, so much.",

Every single day, someone tells me how incredible you are, and every single time, I smile because I already know.\n\nYou’ve faced challenges that could have made you bitter or discouraged, but instead, you became stronger. You became wiser. You became more compassionate. You’ve shown me how to choose joy, even when it’s gluten free. You’ve shown your brothers what kindness looks like. You’ve shown the world what it means to live with a glass half full.\n\nYou’ve helped me become the father I always hoped to be. Watching you grow up has been the greatest honor of my life. And now, as you step into your teenage years, you’re not someone still trying to figure out who they are. You already know. And you’re not afraid to be that person. You’ll inspire others to do the same.\n\nWherever your journey takes you, just know I’m always walking right behind you. Cheering you on. Learning from you. Loving you more than words can hold.\n\nI am so proud of you. And this world is better with you in it.\n\nTo the ends of the earth, happy birthday, Jace.",

Your beauty and thoughtfulness shine through in everything you do. Your natural ability to mother has become a superpower, one that you’ve earned through hard work and dedication. I’ve seen the effort you put in, silently and without complaint. You never hesitate, frown, or vent. The only way anyone would even know of the endless things you do for your family is by witnessing it firsthand—the boxes, the planning, the calendars, the emails, the books, the groceries, the toys, the candy, the art supplies. You are the most stunning and beautiful woman, and somehow, you keep winning mother of the year. As a father, it’s the greatest gift I could hope for our boys.\n\nBeing here in Greece with you is a testament to the relationship we’ve built. The moments we’ve shared in this life, and those we continue to create, mean the world to me. You’ve brought such joy, clarity, and meaning to my life, improving my mental and physical well-being every single day. Today, as we celebrate you, I want you to know how profoundly you impact not only me, but those around you. With you, the skies keep getting bluer, and the waters keeps getting clearer.",

They bring out the best in each other and have formed a strong support system, backed by blood, sweat, tears, and tickle fights.\n\nC.S. Lewis said, ‘In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out.’ This couldn’t be more true, especially within brotherhood. My sons are not just growing up together, they’re growing into each other’s strengths and life stories. They are brothers in the most profound sense, and that’s something truly deserving of the most meaningful word I know.",

It grows richer with every new experience we share and every bit of beauty we take in. The more we learn to appreciate all of the beauty, the more we see of it…the more we experience it. \n\nThe other night, Jace asked me, ‘Daddy, has living here changed you?’ I felt the entirety of that question, and after a thoughtful pause, I said, ‘Yes, it has.’ And before I could even finish, he burst out, ‘Me too!’ \n\nThat moment will stay with me forever, melting my heart and sending the good shivers down my spine.

Belief—it’s a peculiar thing. It seems you only truly accomplish something once you deeply, unquestionably know that you will—that’s when you actually do it. It’s so common for us to identify with the stories we tell ourselves, the ones we choose to believe in. And eventually, we become the very characters we’ve described.\n\nThe narrative of our lives is being written, and inevitably, we’ll walk upon a ledge. We can stand there, peering over the edge, and if we do, the ending is as certain as the ground below. But there’s another choice. If we can convince ourselves to believe—to trust—that when we leap from this ledge, when we dive into the unknown, the world has actually been patiently waiting all this time to catch us on the other side and share with us all its beauty.\n\nThat’s a story I can tell, a true story. Because I’m a storyteller.",
